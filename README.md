# Westfield Core CSS Framework

The Westfield Core CSS Framework (WFC) sits on top of our open source CSS framework [Scally](https://github.com/westfieldlabs/scally) and is specific to Westfield, mostly based off this: <http://styleguide.westfieldlabs.com/>.

It follows the exact same architecture as [Scally](https://github.com/westfieldlabs/scally).

Think of WFC as the lick of paint and Scally as the scaffolding.

*More documentation coming soon*, in the meantime ask any questions in the **Westfield Core Framework** HipChat room or email any of the Westfield Labs front end engineers:
